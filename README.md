# Appium Mobile Tests with TypeScript

This project runs Android and iOS mobile UI tests with TypeScript, WebdriverIO,
Mocha, and the TestMu AI (formerly LambdaTest) real-device cloud.

## LambdaTest script generator agent

The workspace custom agent is defined in
[`lambdatest-script-generator.agent.md`](./.github/agents/lambdatest-script-generator.agent.md).
In VS Code Copilot Chat, select **LambdaTest Script Generator** from the agent
dropdown. If it is not listed, open **Chat: Configure Custom Agents** from the
Command Palette and check that workspace agents are enabled for your harness.
You need a VS Code/Copilot setup that supports custom agents.

Example prompt:

```text
Create a regression test for logging out and logging back in on Android and iOS.
Provision a fresh member using the existing helper, reuse the page objects,
assert the home greeting after the second login, and register the test in the
regression pack. Run local validation only; do not start a LambdaTest session.
```

Provide the journey, expected results, target platform, and pack. For new screens,
provide confirmed selectors or sanitized Appium page source. The agent reuses
existing helpers, adds spec/runner wiring and documentation, and reports local
validation separately from live execution. It requires approval before cloud
sessions or backend provisioning. No API key or extra dependency is needed to
add the agent; generated live tests still need the credentials described below.
This is a Copilot custom agent, not a standalone generator CLI or LambdaTest MCP
server.

### Official LambdaTest Appium skill

The generator also uses the official
[`appium-skill`](./.github/skills/appium-skill/SKILL.md) from
[LambdaTest/agent-skills](https://github.com/LambdaTest/agent-skills).
Its JavaScript/WebdriverIO, cloud, iOS, and hybrid-app references are included.
The [upstream revision](./.github/skills/appium-skill/UPSTREAM.md) and
[MIT license](./.github/skills/appium-skill/LICENSE) are retained.

For VS Code Copilot, the skill is installed under `.github/skills/`, not
`.cursor/skills/` (the Cursor-specific location). No duplicate installation is
needed. Open **Chat: Open Customizations** or the skills menu to confirm it is
discovered; discovery depends on the selected harness and VS Code version.
The generator agent explicitly references it while preserving this project's
TypeScript/Mocha conventions and cloud-execution approval requirements.

This installs reusable AI instructions, not a LambdaTest API/MCP connection
or a Copilot SDK generator service. It does not upload apps, provision members,
or launch paid device sessions.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later and npm
- A TestMu AI account with a username and access key
- Appium-uploaded Android and/or iOS application IDs

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configure credentials

Set the following environment variables or copy
[`lambdatest.properties.example`](./lambdatest.properties.example) to
`lambdatest.properties` and fill in the values. Local credentials files are
ignored by Git.

Required settings:

- `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY` (legacy aliases `UserName` and `AccessKey`
  are also accepted)
- An App ID: set `appId` (direct override), `LT_ANDROID_APP_ID` /
  `LT_IOS_APP_ID` (platform-specific), or `LT_APP_ID` (shared fallback). There
  is no built-in default — the run fails fast with a clear error if none of
  these are set. Note that the Android app ID used to differ by scenario
  (login/ios-login/screening/mha used one app, lockout used another); you are
  now responsible for setting the correct one per run.
- `APP_PASSWORD` for registration of generated login/logout, MHA and lockout users,
  and for screening login. `APP_USERNAME` is used for screening.
- `INCORRECT_APP_PASSWORD` for the account-lockout test
  (`APP_INCORRECT_PASSWORD` is also accepted as a legacy alias).
  It must differ from `APP_PASSWORD`. The test provisions and locks a fresh
  account; `LOCKOUT_USERNAME` is not required.

The mental-health assessment journeys, login/logout and lockout scenarios provision a new
member account in a Mocha suite-level `before` hook for each worker run. Setup performs
party creation, enrolment, registration, status calculation, login-event
capture, reward/event processing and onboarding-instruction deletion. Setup failures
fail the suite's setup hook and prevent its tests from running, preserving the
original configuration or API error; there is no fallback to a fixed account.
`testAccounts.member` exposes the selected profile's `LOGIN_PREFIX` plus the generated
email only after setup succeeds. API requests use the unprefixed email.
The password is always read from `APP_PASSWORD`, never stored in the fixture.
Configure the profile's `API_BEARER_TOKEN`, `API_BASIC_AUTH`, `LOGIN_PREFIX`,
`ZUUL_URL`, `TENANT_NUMBER`, `INTEGRATION_PLATFORM_BASE_URL`, `EMAIL_DOMAIN`
and shared `configUserAgent` in user-creation settings before these runs.

The read-only `getUserInstruction` lookup (sent as a POST by the backend API)
has a 30-second timeout per attempt and up to three attempts, with 500 ms and
1,000 ms backoff. Only transient network errors, timeouts and HTTP 502/503/504
are retried; authentication, TLS and invalid-response errors fail immediately.
Retry warnings and final errors identify the endpoint and network error code
without logging credentials or the request body, and retain the original cause.
For persistent failures, check backend availability and the runner's VPN, DNS,
proxy and TLS configuration. The lookup runs from the Node.js worker, not from
the cloud device. Account creation and other provisioning writes are not retried
automatically, to avoid duplicate side effects.

Environment variables take precedence over `lambdatest.properties` in the
project root or `src/test/resources/`. Use environment variables instead of
Java's former `-DKEY=value` system properties.

Optional settings:

- `LT_GRID_URL` (defaults to `mobile-hub.lambdatest.com`)
- `platform` / `PLATFORM`, `device` / `LT_DEVICE`, and `version` / `LT_VERSION`
- `LT_BUILD_NAME`, `LT_TEST_NAME`, and `LT_PROJECT_NAME`
  Cloud session names are assigned from each worker's spec filename before
  the session starts (for example, `login-logout` or `mha-high-risk`).
  If `LT_TEST_NAME` is set, it is used as a prefix followed by the spec name,
  so parallel pack sessions remain distinguishable. Build names are unchanged.
- `LT_ARTIFACTS_DIR` (defaults to `target/test-artifacts`)
- `LT_WAIT_SECONDS` (defaults to `300`)
- `LT_TEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` controls the whole test independently of element
  waits. Every scenario defaults to `900` seconds (15 minutes), regardless of
  platform. It must exceed `LT_WAIT_SECONDS`.
- `LT_OPEN_LIVE_SESSION` (defaults to `true`): as soon as a mobile session
  starts, its LambdaTest App Automation dashboard page (live device view +
  Appium logs) is opened automatically in your default browser. Set this to
  `false` to disable auto-opening; it's also skipped automatically when a `CI`
  environment variable is set. The session ID and dashboard URL are always
  logged to the console and to `execution.log` regardless of this setting.

## Run the scenarios

### Smoke and regression packs

```bash
npm run test:smoke
npm run test:regression
VG_ENVIRONMENT=mdev PLATFORM=iOS npm run test:smoke
PLATFORM=iOS npm run test:smoke
PLATFORM=iOS npm run test:regression
```

| Pack | Specs |
| --- | --- |
| Smoke | `login-logout.spec.ts`, `mha-high-risk.spec.ts` |
| Regression | `incorrect-password-lockout.spec.ts`, `mha-low-risk.spec.ts` |

These named WebdriverIO suites run only the listed specs, sequentially
(`maxInstances: 1`), with a separate, freshly reset mobile session and a newly
provisioned member for each spec. They use the existing cloud, platform, app,
and user-creation settings; no credentials are stored in the suite definitions.
Regression also requires `INCORRECT_APP_PASSWORD`.
Specs are resolved from `tests/smoke/` and `tests/regression/`; the scenario
registry stores paths relative to `tests/`, not the former `tests/testScenarios/`.
Direct runner selection is supported with
`npm test -- --suite smoke` or `npm test -- --suite regression`; leave
`LT_SCENARIO` unset or use a valid scenario from `src/config/runner.ts`.

MHA question screens use native iOS accessibility-ID and predicate selectors to
avoid XPath hierarchy evaluation during each question/answer/button lookup.
Android selectors and visibility waits remain unchanged. Device/cloud command
latency still affects execution time; this does not disable animation or readiness checks.
After the final assessment answer, the flow clicks Submit once without first
waiting for a question Next button. Intermediate question and section navigation
is preserved.

### User-creation environments

User provisioning reads its settings from `user-creation.properties`, separately
from the mobile/cloud settings in `lambdatest.properties`. Copy
[`user-creation.properties.example`](./user-creation.properties.example) to
`user-creation.properties` and fill in the selected profile. The local file is
ignored by Git; never commit API credentials.

Set `VG_ENVIRONMENT` to `mdev`, `ca-test`, or `ca-dev` (default: `mdev`).
The corresponding prefixes are `VG_MDEV_`, `VG_CA_TEST_`, and `VG_CA_DEV_`.
Each profile requires `TENANT_NUMBER`, `ZUUL_URL`,
`INTEGRATION_PLATFORM_BASE_URL`, `VITALITY_PRODUCT_KEY`,
`MEMBERSHIP_REFERENCE_KEYS` (comma-separated), `EMAIL_DOMAIN`, and
`API_BASIC_AUTH` (base64 credentials, optionally prefixed with `Basic`).
Product keys accept `VITALITYACTIVEV1`, `SLI_VITALITY`, or numeric values.
Membership reference keys accept `POLICY_NUMBER`,
`PARTNER_CONTRACT_NUMBER`, or numeric values.

Runtime environment variables override this separate file:

```bash
VG_ENVIRONMENT=ca-test PLATFORM=Android npm run test:mha-high-risk
```

Provisioning settings previously stored in `lambdatest.properties` must be moved
to the new file. These settings only apply when a test calls
`resolveTestUserCredentials()`; fixed-account tests are unchanged.

```bash
PLATFORM=Android npm run test:login
PLATFORM=iOS npm run test:login
npm run test:android
npm run test:ios
npm run test:lockout
npm run test:mha
PLATFORM=Android npm run test:mha-high-risk
PLATFORM=iOS npm run test:mha-high-risk
npm run test:screening
```

The login, lockout, MHA, and screening commands use `platform` / `PLATFORM` if set;
otherwise they default to Android. Override the target with `PLATFORM=iOS`
(macOS/Linux) or set it in `lambdatest.properties`.

`LT_SCENARIO` selects the matching uploaded app and spec:

| Scenario | `LT_SCENARIO` | Default platform app |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform-selected login/logout | `login` | Android or iOS login app |
| Android login/logout | `android-login` | Android login app |
| iOS login/logout | `ios-login` | iOS login app |
| Incorrect-password lockout | `lockout` | Lockout app |
| Mental-health assessment | `mha` | MHA app |
| Screening/vaccination form | `screening` | MHA app |

`test:login` runs `tests/testScenarios/login-logout.spec.ts` on the selected platform.
The `test:android` and `test:ios` commands run the same spec with an explicit
platform and retain their platform-specific scenario defaults.

You can target another device or uploaded app without editing the project:

```bash
PLATFORM=iOS LT_DEVICE="iPhone 15" LT_VERSION=17 LT_IOS_APP_ID=lt://APP_ID npm run test:ios
```

To type-check the project:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Run the local unit tests without a device or cloud session:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Mobile scenarios use WebdriverIO's Mocha adapter with the BDD interface
(`describe` / `it`). Local utility regression tests use Node's built-in test
runner with the existing TypeScript loader.

## Project structure

```text
src/
  config/       # Credentials, capabilities, scenario registry, timeouts
  screens/      # Platform-aware page objects and assertions
  utils/        # Mobile session interactions, reporting, browser launching
tests/
  fixtures/     # Non-secret account data and assessment JSON
  helpers/      # Reusable navigation, login, and home-screen flows
  specs/        # Mocha mobile scenarios (*.spec.ts)
  unit/         # Local regression tests (*.test.ts)
wdio.conf.ts    # Runner settings and session/reporting hooks
```

Five specs cover login/logout (Android and iOS), lockout, MHA low risk, MHA high
risk, and screening/vaccination. `src/config/runner.ts` contains the
scenario-to-spec registry and smoke/regression suite definitions. Common flows stay in helpers, while
screen-specific locators and interactions stay in page objects.

Each test writes its execution log, screenshots, and (on failure) page source to
a timestamped directory under `target/test-artifacts/`. Generated artifacts,
legacy `test-output/` reports, and coverage output are ignored by Git. These
directories are recreated as needed; they do not belong in source control.

## Allure reports

Every mobile scenario also writes Allure results to `target/allure-results/`.
The console spec reporter and existing timestamped artifacts remain enabled.
Allure includes execution steps, screenshots, session configuration, execution
logs, and page source captured on failure.

Run a scenario and then generate and open its HTML report:

```bash
PLATFORM=Android npm run test:mha-high-risk
npm run report:generate
npm run report:open
```

Run report generation even when the test fails to inspect the failure evidence.
The Allure command-line tool requires Java on your PATH (`JAVA_HOME` may also
be used). Report generation is explicit, so it does not change the test exit
status or open another browser during test execution.

Results accumulate across runs. `report:generate` replaces only the generated
HTML report, not raw results. For a fresh report, remove the specific
`target/allure-results/` directory before starting the next run. Both results
and reports are ignored by Git under `target/`. They can contain account and
screen data; keep them private and restrict access to CI artifacts.

## Scrolling

Scroll-to-element actions use short, slow swipes (15% of the screen height over
1.5 seconds), hold before releasing to reduce momentum, and wait 750 ms for the
screen to settle. Before each swipe, the target is checked for visibility and an
on-screen center. Scrolling stops and clicks the target as soon as it is visible,
or fails after the page object's configured maximum number of swipes.

## iOS execution time

Exact iOS `name` XPath locators use native XCUITest predicate queries, including
Next/Submit button alternatives. Complex XPath locators remain unchanged.
MHA answer selection uses a native label/name predicate and a single
wait-and-click operation. Each section and question is logged so a stalled
question can be identified instead of only seeing the overall timeout.

Every execution has a 15-minute whole-test timeout by default, including the
MHA journey's login, scrolling, questions, and results verification.
Increasing the whole-test timeout does
not increase individual element waits. For a custom limit, set
`LT_TEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` in the local properties file or environment.
